								<p class="featuretext"><span class="dropcap">S</span>telios is an experienced Data Analyst at Mellon Technologies, 
									an affiliate of <a href="https://mellongroup.com/" >Mellon Group of Companies</a>, who is evolving into a 
									Data Engineer. So many stories have been told about Data journeys, but Stelios wants to write his own path in 
									Data Science field.</p>
								<p></p>
							
							<p>Troubleshooter since his childhood, always wanted to help his relatives and friends about all kinds of tech issues: 
								Either updating drivers and installing new versions or taking care the format of a system, 
								Stelios showed his nerdiness from a very young age.</p>
							<p>He possesses a Bachelor Degree in Statistics and Insurance Science Department from University of Piraeus. 
								How obvious choice for someone who always poses problems to himself? Here is an overview of main lessons 
								based on categories:</p>

					<p>During his undergraduate studies, Stelios went freelance to research. He helped many students to complete statistical analysis
						in their Thesis. Most projects were in theoretical studied, such as Pedagogy, Psychology and Sociology. The questionnaires were
						provided most of times but we had to determine the proper sampling method of each research. Both hypothesis testing were 
						conducted  and various visualisation were included in the analysis. A story was constructed with statistical tools, and the conclusion
						was a brief explanation and the key points of our statistical analysis.
					</p>
					<p>With just a few lessons left until graduation, Stelios decided to complete his 9-month mandatory military service in Hellenic Armed Forces.
						During his service, he have finally graduated in February 2021! But the journey could not begin due to the service, which lasted for at least 6 more months. 
						In August 2021, Stelios finished his military service and was finally able to begin his professional journey!
					</p>
					<p>Every beginning has its own difficulties. Stelios was outsourced with a contract to Speedex SA, 
						a transport company for a Data Entry project. He was working for 40 hours per week, but he was also trying to achieve his goal: 
						a Data Analyst position! Day and night, Stelios was constantly improving his abilities with courses, applying in LinkedIn, preparing 
						for interviews and broadening his network. </p>
					<p>Thanks to Mellon Technologies, Stelios landed on February 2022 in a Data Analyst position! Stelios adapted quickly to his new professional 
						responsibilities. He continued to develop in Python and make documentation on a Machine Learning product. He also created various reports
						and dashboard upon this ML model on Power BI. In the meanwhile, he was working on various projects as part of a team or individually.
						One of his greatest achievement was the creation of a user interface using Python which reads files in, manipulates data
						as requires and provides a summary report with key KPIs. Data models and internal data where stored in MySQL databases and 
						stored procedures where scheduled to verify the results of some procedures. He has also some experience in GitHub and Git. 
						</p>
					<p>On the end of November 2022, Mellon Technologies and Stelios will go separate ways. Stay tuned for his next destination...</p>
